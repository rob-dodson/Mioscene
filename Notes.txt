/*
 
 Use @State for very simple data like Int, Bool, or String. Think situations like whether a toggle is on or off, or whether a dialog is open or closed.
 Use @StateObject to create any type that is more complex than what @State can handle. Ensure that the type conforms to ObservableObject, and has @Published wrappers on the properties you would like to cause the view to re-render, or you’d like to update from a view. Always use @StateObject when you are instantiating a model.
 Use @ObservedObject to allow a parent view to pass down to a child view an already created ObservableObject (via @StateObject).
 Use @EnvironmentObject to consume an ObservableObject that has already been created in a parent view and then attached via the view’s environmentObject() view modifier.

@icecubesapp You know what would help me? A unified timeline, Twitterrific-style, where the contents of Home and Mentions are (optionally) combined chronologically into a single timeline.
